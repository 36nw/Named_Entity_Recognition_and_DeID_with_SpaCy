# Text Summarization Using Web Scraping and NLTK
This repository contains Python scripts for web scraping and text summarization. Using BeautifulSoup, the script extracts content from the Wikipedia page on Natural Language Processing. The project includes Python-based implementations for text preprocessing, word frequency analysis, and sentence ranking. It also includes both word frequency and N-gram-based techniques for summarization, comparing the performance of each method to evaluate the quality of the summaries produced.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. It also covers basic text analysis and visualization using word clouds to gain insights into the text data.

## Installation

To use the scripts in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed. Additionally, install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk wordcloud matplotlib
```

After installing the required packages, you will also need to download additional NLTK resources.

```bash
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## Usage

**1. Preprocessing**: This section contains functions for tokenizing the text, removing stopwords, and applying stemming.

**2. Analysis**: This section includes code for basic text analysis, such as word frequency distribution and generating statistics about the text.

**3. Visualization**: This section demonstrates how to create and display word clouds from the processed text data.
