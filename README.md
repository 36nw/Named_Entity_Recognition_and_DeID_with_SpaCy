# Text Summarization Using Web Scraping and NLTK
This repository contains Python scripts for web scraping and text summarization. Using BeautifulSoup, the script extracts content from the Wikipedia page on Natural Language Processing. The project includes Python-based implementations for text preprocessing, word frequency analysis, and sentence ranking. It also includes both word frequency and N-gram-based techniques for summarization, comparing the performance of each method to evaluate the quality of the summaries produced.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. It also covers basic text analysis and visualization using word clouds to gain insights into the text data.

## Installation

To use the scripts in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed. Additionally, install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
pip install nltk wordcloud matplotlib


After installing the required packages, you will also need to download additional NLTK resources.

bash
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

## Usage

**1. Preprocessing**: 
- The preprocessing steps involve tokenizing the raw text from a webpage, cleaning it by removing stopwords and punctuation, and preparing it for analysis. This process is done using libraries like nltk, re, and string for tokenization and filtering.
- The text is first scraped from a webpage using the scrape_webpage function. Then, the text is tokenized into words, and stop words and punctuation are removed using nltk's built-in stopwords and a custom list of punctuation characters.
- The cleaned text is prepared for further analysis by computing word frequencies and sentence scores.

**2. Analysis**: 
- In this section, word frequency distributions are calculated using nltk.FreqDist, which provides insights into how often certain words appear in the document. This helps identify key terms in the text.
- Sentence scores are calculated based on the frequency of the words in each sentence, with more frequent words leading to higher scores. The sentences are then sorted by their scores.
- Additionally, N-gram models (bigrams, trigrams, etc.) are generated, and their frequencies are computed using nltk.util.ngrams and FreqDist. These N-grams help in analyzing the relationships between adjacent words, adding another layer of insight into the content of the text.

**3. Visualization**: 
- After generating N-grams, the frequency distributions are visualized using nltk.FreqDist.plot(), which displays the most common N-grams in the text. This allows for a graphical representation of which word combinations are most frequent.
- Additionally, the most common N-grams (bigrams, trigrams, etc.) are printed out to give a textual representation of the frequent phrases within the text.

## Data

The data for this project is scraped from web pages using BeautifulSoup. It consists of plain text extracted from paragraphs on the page (e.g., from Wikipedia). The text is then processed through tokenization, stopword removal, and punctuation filtering. The dataset is used for text summarization tasks, focusing on calculating word frequencies and generating summaries based on sentence, word count, or percentage.
